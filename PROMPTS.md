# 📘 PROMPTS.md — Prompt Design Guide for NoteBook-X

Welcome to the **Prompt Design Guide** for the `NoteBook-X` project. This guide is here to help you understand how we use prompts to generate high-quality, AI-assisted study notes using tools like **ChatGPT** and **Gemini**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Guide

- 🤖 Show how prompts are used to generate educational content
- ✍️ Teach contributors how to write or improve prompts
- 🔍 Help ensure uniform quality and structure across all notes

## 🧠 What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is a carefully crafted instruction given to an AI model like ChatGPT to produce a desired output. For this project, prompts generate:

- 🔍 Chapter summaries
- 📝 Key point bullet notes
- ❓FAQs & PYQs
- 🧾 Structured diagrams, tables, and timelines
- 💡 Key concepts

## ✍️ Prompt Format Template

Here’s a sample structure for each prompt file:

```md

## 🎯 Objective
Explain what you want the AI to generate. (e.g., “Summarize Chapter 1 in 10 bullet points”)

## 🧠 Prompt Used
```
[Paste the actual prompt you gave to the AI. Example below:]

"Summarize Chapter 1 from Class X NCERT History book in simple language. Use bullet points and avoid long paragraphs. Mention key dates and people. Add 2-3 FAQs with answers."
```

## 🧾 AI Output (Optional)
Include the AI’s response (especially if it was good and reused)

## 🛠️ Edits / Notes (Optional)
Mention if you edited or fixed anything manually. Write like:
- Fixed historical date
- Added missing FAQ
