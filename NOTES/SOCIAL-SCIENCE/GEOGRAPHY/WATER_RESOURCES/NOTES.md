# WATER RESOURCES: CONCISE STUDY GUIDE

## WATER AVAILABILITY AND SCARCITY

| Facts About Water | Details |
|---|---|
| Global Distribution | Three-fourth of earth's surface covered with water, but only small proportion is usable freshwater |
| Source of Freshwater | Surface runoff and groundwater, continuously renewed through hydrological cycle |
| Projected Scarcity | Nearly two billion people expected to live in absolute water scarcity by 2025 |

### Causes of Water Scarcity

- Over-exploitation of water resources
- Excessive water usage
- Unequal access among social groups
- Growing population creating greater water demands
- Agricultural overuse (irrigated agriculture is largest consumer)
- Industrial pressure on freshwater resources
- Urbanization with dense populations
- Water quality deterioration from pollution

## WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT APPROACHES

### Multi-Purpose River Projects

| Functions | Examples |
|---|---|
| Irrigation for agriculture | Bhakra-Nangal project (Sutlej-Beas basin) |
| Electricity generation | Hirakud project (Mahanadi basin) |
| Domestic and industrial water supply | Sardar Sarovar Dam (Narmada River) |
| Flood control | |
| Recreation | |
| Inland navigation | |
| Fish breeding | |

### Concerns with Large Dam Projects

- Disruption of rivers' natural flow affecting aquatic ecosystems
- Excessive sedimentation in reservoirs
- Fragmentation of river systems impeding aquatic fauna migration
- Submergence of existing vegetation and soil
- Paradoxical triggering of floods due to reservoir sedimentation
- Failure to control floods during excessive rainfall
- Deprivation of natural silt fertilization on floodplains
- Induced seismic activity
- Increased water-borne diseases and pests
- Shift to water-intensive commercial crops leading to soil salinization

### Government Water Management Initiatives

| Initiative | Objective |
|---|---|
| Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) | Provide assured potable piped water (55 liters per capita per day) to rural households |
| Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana | Ensure irrigation access ("har khet ko pani") and improve water use efficiency ("per drop more crop") |
| Atal Bhujal Yojana | Promote water conservation in water-stressed areas across seven states |

## TRADITIONAL WATER HARVESTING SYSTEMS

| Region | Technique | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Western Himalayas | 'Guls' or 'Kuls' (diversion channels) | Agriculture |
| Rajasthan | Rooftop rainwater harvesting | Drinking water |
| Bengal Flood Plains | Inundation channels | Irrigation |
| Jaisalmer | 'Khadins' | Convert agricultural fields into rain-fed storage |
| Other parts of Rajasthan | 'Johads' | Convert agricultural fields into rain-fed storage |
| Semi-arid Rajasthan | Underground tanks ('tankas') | Store drinking water |

### Modern Adaptations of Traditional Methods

- Rooftop rainwater harvesting in Tamil Nadu (first state to make it compulsory)
- Shillong, Meghalaya: 15-25% of household water from rooftop harvesting despite nearby Cherrapunji receiving highest rainfall
- Gendathur village, Karnataka: 200 households installed rooftop systems, harvesting ~100,000 liters annually
- Bamboo drip irrigation system in Meghalaya: 200-year-old method using bamboo pipes to transport water

## INTER-STATE WATER DISPUTES

- Krishna-Godavari dispute: Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh objected to Maharashtra's water diversion at Koyna
- Water disputes often arise from concerns about reduced downstream flow affecting agriculture and industry

## KEY DEFINITIONS

**Water Scarcity**: A situation where demand for water exceeds available supply, caused not only by low rainfall but also by overexploitation, excessive use, and unequal access.

**Multi-Purpose Projects**: Dams built not just for irrigation but for electricity generation, water supply, flood control, recreation, inland navigation, and fish breeding.

**Rainwater Harvesting**: Collection and storage of rainwater from surfaces (rooftops, land, rock catchments) for future use, adapted to local ecological conditions.

**Tankas**: Underground tanks in Rajasthan for storing drinking water, connected to sloping rooftops through pipes.

## FLOWCHARTS

### Water Scarcity Cycle
```
Population Growth → Increased Water Demand → Overexploitation of Water Resources → 
Falling Groundwater Levels → Water Scarcity → Food Insecurity → Social and Economic Problems
```

### Traditional Water Management vs. Modern Approaches
```
Traditional Approaches                     Modern Approaches
(Sustainable, Localized)                  (Large-scale, Centralized)

Local Storage Systems ←→ Multi-Purpose Dam Projects
     |                                          |

```

### Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting System
```
Rainfall on Rooftop → Collection through Pipes → Filtration → 
Storage in Underground Tank → Availability for Use → Groundwater Recharge
```
