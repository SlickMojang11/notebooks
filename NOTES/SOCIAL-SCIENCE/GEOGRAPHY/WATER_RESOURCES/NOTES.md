# WATER RESOURCES: COMPREHENSIVE STUDY GUIDE

## WATER AVAILABILITY AND SCARCITY

| Facts About Water | Details |
|---|---|
| Global Distribution | Three-fourth of earth's surface covered with water, but only small proportion is usable freshwater |
| Source of Freshwater | Surface runoff and groundwater, continuously renewed through hydrological cycle |
| Projected Scarcity | Nearly two billion people expected to live in absolute water scarcity by 2025 |
| Renewability | All water moves within hydrological cycle making it a renewable resource |

### Causes of Water Scarcity

- Over-exploitation of water resources
- Excessive water usage
- Unequal access among social groups
- Growing population creating greater water demands
- Agricultural overuse (irrigated agriculture is largest consumer)
- Industrial pressure on freshwater resources
- Urbanization with dense populations
- Water quality deterioration from pollution
- **Industrial expansion** requiring both water and energy
- **Urban lifestyle changes** increasing water consumption
- **Unplanned groundwater extraction** by housing societies

### Common Misconceptions About Water Scarcity

- Not limited to low rainfall or drought-prone regions
- Can occur even in areas with sufficient water if quality is compromised
- Can exist in areas with ample water resources due to poor management

## WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT APPROACHES

### Multi-Purpose River Projects

| Functions | Examples |
|---|---|
| Irrigation for agriculture | Bhakra-Nangal project (Sutlej-Beas basin) |
| Electricity generation | Hirakud project (Mahanadi basin) |
| Domestic and industrial water supply | Sardar Sarovar Dam (Narmada River) |
| Flood control | Hirakud Dam on Mahanadi |
| Recreation | |
| Inland navigation | |
| Fish breeding | |

### Historical Development of Water Management in India

- Ancient India had sophisticated hydraulic structures:
  - Sringaverapura (1st century B.C.) - channeling Ganga flood water
  - Chandragupta Maurya era - extensive dams, lakes, irrigation systems
  - Evidence in Kalinga, Nagarjunakonda, Bennur, Kolhapur
  - 11th Century - Bhopal Lake (one of largest artificial lakes)
  - 14th Century - Hauz Khas tank by Iltutmish for Siri Fort area

### Concerns with Large Dam Projects

- Disruption of rivers' natural flow affecting aquatic ecosystems
- Excessive sedimentation in reservoirs
- Fragmentation of river systems impeding aquatic fauna migration
- Submergence of existing vegetation and soil leading to decomposition
- Paradoxical triggering of floods due to reservoir sedimentation
- Failure to control floods during excessive rainfall
- Deprivation of natural silt fertilization on floodplains
- Induced seismic activity
- Increased water-borne diseases and pests
- Shift to water-intensive commercial crops leading to soil salinization

### Government Water Management Initiatives

| Initiative | Objective |
|---|---|
| Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) | Provide assured potable piped water (55 liters per capita per day) to rural households |
| Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana | Ensure irrigation access ("har khet ko pani") and improve water use efficiency ("per drop more crop") |
| Atal Bhujal Yojana | Promote water conservation in water-stressed areas across seven states: Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh |

## INTERSTATE WATER DISPUTES

- Krishna-Godavari dispute: Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh objected to Maharashtra's water diversion at Koyna
- Concerns about reduced downstream flow affecting agriculture and industry
- Water disputes arise when upstream states divert more water, affecting downstream states

## TRADITIONAL WATER HARVESTING SYSTEMS

| Region | Technique | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Western Himalayas | 'Guls' or 'Kuls' (diversion channels) | Agriculture |
| Rajasthan | Rooftop rainwater harvesting | Drinking water |
| Bengal Flood Plains | Inundation channels | Irrigation |
| Jaisalmer | 'Khadins' | Convert agricultural fields into rain-fed storage |
| Other parts of Rajasthan | 'Johads' | Convert agricultural fields into rain-fed storage |
| Semi-arid Rajasthan | Underground tanks ('tankas') | Store drinking water |

### Underground Tankas in Rajasthan

- Built inside main house or courtyard
- Connected to sloping roofs through pipes
- First spell of rain usually not collected (used for cleaning roofs and pipes)
- Water from subsequent showers collected
- Tankas as large as a room (example: 6.1m deep, 4.27m long, 2.44m wide in Phalodi)
- Underground rooms built adjoining tankas to keep cool in summer
- Provides reliable drinking water when other sources dry up in summer
- "Palar pani" (rainwater) considered purest form of natural water

### Modern Adaptations of Traditional Methods

- Rooftop rainwater harvesting in Tamil Nadu (first state to make it compulsory)
- Shillong, Meghalaya: 15-25% of household water from rooftop harvesting despite nearby Cherrapunji receiving highest rainfall
- Gendathur village, Karnataka: 200 households installed rooftop systems, each collecting ~50,000 liters annually (total 10 million liters)
- Bamboo drip irrigation system in Meghalaya: 200-year-old method using bamboo pipes
  - Taps stream and spring water
  - Transports water over hundreds of meters
  - Delivers 20-80 drops per minute directly to plant roots
  - Uses gravity for water flow
  - Controls flow by manipulating pipe positions

## KEY DEFINITIONS

**Water Scarcity**: A situation where demand for water exceeds available supply, caused not only by low rainfall but also by overexploitation, excessive use, and unequal access. Can occur even in areas with ample water resources due to poor quality or mismanagement.

**Multi-Purpose Projects**: Dams built not just for irrigation but for electricity generation, water supply, flood control, recreation, inland navigation, and fish breeding. These projects integrate multiple water uses to maximize benefits from a single water resource.

**Rainwater Harvesting**: Collection and storage of rainwater from surfaces (rooftops, land, rock catchments) for future use, adapted to local ecological conditions. Includes traditional and modern methods for conserving water at source.

**Tankas**: Underground tanks in Rajasthan for storing drinking water, connected to sloping rooftops through pipes. Traditional storage structures that keep water cool and provide reliable drinking water during dry seasons.

**Dam**: A barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or retards flow, creating a reservoir. Classified by structure (timber, embankment, masonry), purpose, or height. The term often refers to the reservoir rather than just the structure.

**Hydrological Cycle**: The continuous movement of water on, above, and below the earth's surface through processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff, ensuring water's renewability.

**Guls/Kuls**: Diversion channels built in Western Himalayas to redirect water from natural streams to agricultural fields through gravity flow.

**Khadins/Johads**: Traditional agricultural water harvesting structures that convert fields into rain-fed storage systems in arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan.

**Inundation Channels**: Water diversion structures in Bengal flood plains used to harness flood waters for irrigation purposes.

**Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting System**: Modern adaptation of traditional methods where rainwater from rooftops is collected through pipes, filtered, and stored in underground tanks for domestic use or groundwater recharge.
