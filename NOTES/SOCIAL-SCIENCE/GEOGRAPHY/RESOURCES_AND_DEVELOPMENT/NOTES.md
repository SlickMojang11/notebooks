| **Old Alluvial (Bangar)** | Contains 'Kankar' nodules, coarser texture, less fertile | Higher reaches above flood plains | Lower fertility |
| **New Alluvial (Khadar)** | Fresh silt deposits, finer texture, lighter color | Flood plains near river banks | Highly fertile, ideal for intensive cultivation |


### 6.3 Soil Erosion and Conservation



#### Types of Soil Erosion

| Type | Process | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Gully erosion** | Running water cuts through clayey soils forming deep channels | Creates unusable bad land or ravines (e.g., Chambal basin) |
| **Sheet erosion** | Topsoil washed away by water flowing as a sheet | Gradual loss of fertile topsoil over large areas |
| **Wind erosion** | Wind carries away loose soil particles | Affects dry, loose soils in arid/semi-arid regions |

#### Soil Conservation Methods

| Method | Description | Application |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Contour ploughing** | Ploughing along contour lines | Slows water flow, reduces runoff |
| **Terrace cultivation** | Cutting steps on slopes | Restricts erosion (common in western and central Himalayas) |
| **Strip cropping** | Dividing fields with grass strips | Breaks wind force, reduces soil loss |
| **Shelter belts** | Planting tree lines | Creates wind barriers (effective for sand dune stabilization) |
| **Other measures** | Controlling overgrazing, regulating mining, proper effluent treatment | Multiple environmental benefits |


## 7. Conclusion

Resource management requires balancing development needs with environmental conservation. Judicious resource utilization and effective conservation strategies are essential for ensuring both present well-being and future sustainability. India's diverse resource base offers tremendous potential if managed sustainably with appropriate planning and conservation measures.
