# Minerals and Energy Resources of India

## 1. Key Definitions

- **Mineral**: Homogeneous, naturally occurring substance with a definable internal structure found in the earth's crust. Minerals have specific physical properties like color, hardness, crystal form, luster, and density that depend on their formation conditions.

- **Ore**: Accumulation of minerals mixed with other elements in sufficient concentration to make extraction economically viable. Ores undergo processing to extract valuable minerals.

- **Ferrous Minerals**: Minerals containing iron as their main constituent. Examples include iron ore, manganese, chromite, and nickel. These are essential for the steel industry.

- **Non-Ferrous Minerals**: Minerals without iron content. Examples include copper, bauxite, tin, zinc, gold, and silver. These have various applications in electrical, construction, and manufacturing industries.

- **Conventional Energy**: Traditional sources of energy that have been in use for a long time. These include coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydroelectricity, and firewood. Most are non-renewable except hydroelectricity.

- **Non-Conventional Energy**: Renewable and alternative energy sources including solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, and biogas. These are increasingly important for sustainable development and reducing carbon emissions.

## 2. Mineral Formation and Occurrence

### 2.1 Characteristics

| Environmental | Water contamination, land degradation, river pollution, soil degradation |

### 4.2 Conservation Strategies
- Minerals are finite and non-renewable resources (only 1% of earth's crust)
- Created through geological processes over millions of years
- Needs: Planned and sustainable use, improved technologies for low-grade ores, recycling, substitutes
- Rising costs and decreasing quality with continued extraction

## 5. Energy Resources

### 5.1 Conventional Sources
