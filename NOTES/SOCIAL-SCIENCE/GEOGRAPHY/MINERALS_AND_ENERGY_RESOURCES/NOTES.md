# Minerals and Energy Resources of India

## 1. Key Definitions

- **Mineral**: Homogeneous, naturally occurring substance with a definable internal structure found in the earth's crust. Minerals have specific physical properties like color, hardness, crystal form, luster, and density that depend on their formation conditions.

- **Ore**: Accumulation of minerals mixed with other elements in sufficient concentration to make extraction economically viable. Ores undergo processing to extract valuable minerals.

- **Ferrous Minerals**: Minerals containing iron as their main constituent. Examples include iron ore, manganese, chromite, and nickel. These are essential for the steel industry.

- **Non-Ferrous Minerals**: Minerals without iron content. Examples include copper, bauxite, tin, zinc, gold, and silver. These have various applications in electrical, construction, and manufacturing industries.

- **Conventional Energy**: Traditional sources of energy that have been in use for a long time. These include coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydroelectricity, and firewood. Most are non-renewable except hydroelectricity.

- **Non-Conventional Energy**: Renewable and alternative energy sources including solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, and biogas. These are increasingly important for sustainable development and reducing carbon emissions.

3. **Bellary-Chitradurga-Chikkamagaluru-Tumakuru** (Karnataka): Large reserves including Kudremukh
4. **Maharashtra-Goa**: Lower quality, exported through Marmagao port

#### Manganese
- Used in steel production (10kg per ton), alloys, chemicals

| State | Production Share |
|-------|-----------------|
| Madhya Pradesh | 33% |
| Maharashtra | 27% |
| Odisha | 16% |
| Karnataka | 12% |

|-------|----------------------------|
| Odisha | 65% |
| Jharkhand | 10% |
| Gujarat | 9% |
| Chhattisgarh | 6% |
| Maharashtra | 6% |

#### Limestone
- Calcium carbonates; cement raw material, iron smelting
- **Producers**: Rajasthan, MP, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu

## 4. Mining Hazards and Conservation

### 4.1 Hazards
| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Health | Pulmonary diseases from dust/fumes |
| Safety | Collapsing roofs, inundation, fires |
| Environmental | Water contamination, land degradation, river pollution |

### 4.2 Conservation Strategies
- Minerals are finite and non-renewable
- Needs: Planned use, improved technologies for low-grade ores, recycling, substitutes

## 5. Energy Resources

### 5.1 Conventional Sources

#### Coal
- Provides >50% of India's energy

| Type | Characteristics | Uses |
|------|-----------------|------|
