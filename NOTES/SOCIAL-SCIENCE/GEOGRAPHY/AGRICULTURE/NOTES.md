# AGRICULTURE IN INDIA: KEY POINTS

## Introduction
- Two-thirds of India's population engaged in agriculture
- Produces food for consumption and raw materials for industries
- Export crops include tea, coffee, and spices

## Types of Farming Systems in India

| Farming System | Characteristics | Examples/Regions |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Primitive Subsistence Farming** | • Uses primitive tools (hoe, dao, digging sticks)<br>• Depends on monsoon and natural soil fertility<br>• "Slash and burn" technique<br>• Low land productivity | • Jhumming (Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland)<br>• Pamlou (Manipur)<br>• Dipa (Bastar, Chhattisgarh)<br>• Bewar/Dahiya (Madhya Pradesh)<br>• Podu/Penda (Andhra Pradesh)<br>• Pama Dabi/Koman/Bringa (Odisha)<br>• Kumari (Western Ghats)<br>• Valre/Waltre (Southeastern Rajasthan)<br>• Khil (Himalayan belt)<br>• Kuruwa (Jharkhand) |
| **Intensive Subsistence Farming** | • Labor-intensive methods<br>• High use of biochemical inputs and irrigation<br>• Small, often uneconomical landholdings<br>• Maximum output from limited land | • Areas with high population pressure on land |
| **Commercial Farming** | • Heavy use of modern inputs (HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides)<br>• Varying degrees of commercialization across regions | • Same crop may be commercial in one region, subsistence in another (e.g., rice in Punjab vs. Odisha) |
| **Plantation Farming** | • Single-crop cultivation on large areas<br>• Integration of agricultural and industrial processes<br>• Capital-intensive with migrant labor<br>• Production for industrial raw materials | • Tea (Assam, North Bengal)<br>• Coffee (Karnataka)<br>• Rubber, sugarcane, banana<br>• Requires good transportation networks |
