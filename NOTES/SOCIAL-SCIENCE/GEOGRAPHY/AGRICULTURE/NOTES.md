# AGRICULTURE IN INDIA: COMPREHENSIVE NOTES

## Introduction
- **Scale**: 2/3 of India's population engaged in agriculture
- **Functions**: Food production, industrial raw materials, exports (tea, coffee, spices)
- **Significance**: Primary economic activity since ancient times

## Farming Systems

### Primitive Subsistence Farming
- **Methods**: Uses primitive tools (hoe, dao, digging sticks); "slash and burn" technique
- **Characteristics**: Monsoon-dependent; low productivity; allows natural soil fertility replenishment
- **Regional Names**:
  | Region | Local Name |
  |--------|------------|
  | Northeast India | Jhumming |
  | Manipur | Pamlou |
  | Bastar, A&N Islands | Dipa |
  | Madhya Pradesh | Bewar/Dahiya |
  | Andhra Pradesh | Podu/Penda |
  | Odisha | Pama Dabi/Koman/Bringa |
  | Western Ghats | Kumari |
  | SE Rajasthan | Valre/Waltre |
  | Himalayas | Khil |
  | Jharkhand | Kuruwa |

### Intensive Subsistence Farming
- **Characteristics**: Labor-intensive; high biochemical inputs; irrigation used
- **Land Use**: Small, often uneconomical landholdings; fragmented due to inheritance laws
- **Productivity**: Maximum output from limited land in high population density areas

### Commercial Farming
- **Inputs**: Heavy use of modern technologies (HYV seeds, fertilizers, pesticides)
- **Focus**: Higher productivity and profit orientation
- **Variation**: Same crop may be commercial in one region, subsistence in another (e.g., rice: commercial in Punjab, subsistence in Odisha)

### Plantation Farming
- **Structure**: Single-crop cultivation on large areas; integrated agro-industrial processes
- **Investment**: Capital-intensive with migrant labor; well-developed transportation
- **Examples**: Tea (Assam, WB), Coffee (Karnataka, Kerala, TN), Rubber (Kerala, TN), Sugarcane, Banana
