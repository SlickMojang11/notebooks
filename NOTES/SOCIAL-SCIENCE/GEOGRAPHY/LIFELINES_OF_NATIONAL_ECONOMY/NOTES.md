**Status:** Second largest network globally (62.16 lakh km, 2020-21)
- **Advantages:** Lower construction costs, navigates difficult terrain, economical for short distances, door-to-door service, feeder to other transport modes, lower loading/unloading costs, can negotiate higher gradients

**Road Classification:**
1. **Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:** Delhi-Kolkata-Chennai-Mumbai; North-South (Srinagar-Kanniyakumari) and East-West (Silchar-Porbander) corridors built by NHAI; six-lane highways to reduce time/distance between mega cities
2. **National Highways:** Connect extreme parts; primary road systems
3. **State Highways:** Link state capitals with district headquarters
4. **District Roads:** Connect district HQs with other locations
5. **Rural Roads:** Connect villages with towns (Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana)
6. **Border Roads:** Strategic importance, built by BRO (est. 1960) for northern and northeastern border areas, improves accessibility and economic development in difficult terrain
