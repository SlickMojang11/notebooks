# NCERT Chapter 3: Gender, Religion and Caste - Key Points

This chapter examines three major social divisions in Indian society and their interactions with politics: gender, religion, and caste. These social differences create hierarchies and inequalities that significantly impact democratic politics.

## Overview

The existence of social diversity doesn't threaten democracy, and political expression of social differences can be beneficial in a democratic system. This chapter explores how gender, religion, and caste differences manifest in Indian politics.

## Gender and Politics

### Sexual Division of Labor

- Gender division is often seen as natural but is actually based on social expectations and stereotypes, not biology
- A clear sexual division of labor exists in most families: women handle domestic work (cooking, cleaning, childcare) while men work outside
- When household jobs become paid professions (tailors, cooks in hotels), men readily take them up
- Even when women work outside the home (as most do), their work remains undervalued and often unpaid
- Time use surveys show women work approximately one hour more than men daily (7.5 vs 6.5 hours), yet much of this work goes unrecognized

### Women's Disadvantages in India

- Literacy rate: 54% for women versus 76% for men
- Despite performing well academically, girls often drop out as parents prioritize boys' education
- Women are underrepresented in high-paying professions
- Despite the Equal Remuneration Act (1976), women receive lower pay for equal work across sectors
- Sex-selective abortion has reduced the child sex ratio to 919 girls per 1000 boys, falling below 850 or even 800 in some states
- Women face harassment, exploitation and violence in both public and private spaces, including domestic violence

### Women's Political Representation

- Women's representation in the Lok Sabha reached 14.36% in 2019, while state assemblies have less than 5%
- India ranks among the lowest countries globally in women's political representation, behind many African and Latin American countries
- Progress has come through reservations: one-third of seats in panchayats and municipalities are reserved for women, resulting in over 10 lakh elected women representatives
- The Women's Reservation Act (2023) provides 33% reservation for women in the Lok Sabha, State Assemblies and Delhi Assembly
- Feminist movements worldwide have fought for equal rights, improved legal status, and equal educational and career opportunities

## Religion, Communalism and Politics

### Religion in Politics

- Legitimate expressions of religion in politics include:
  - Gandhiji's view that politics should be guided by moral values derived from religion
  - Human rights groups demanding protection for religious minorities
  - Women's movements challenging discriminatory religious family laws

### Communalism

- Communalism emerges when religion becomes the basis for national identity or is expressed in exclusive and partisan terms
- Communal politics is based on the flawed idea that religion is the principal basis of social community
- Communal thinking assumes:
  - Followers of one religion form a homogeneous community with identical interests
  - People of different religions cannot share a social community
  - In extreme forms, it leads to the belief that people of different religions cannot live as equal citizens in one nation

- These assumptions are fundamentally flawed because:
  - People of one religion have diverse interests and multiple identities
  - Every community contains multiple voices that deserve to be heard

### Forms of Communalism

- Everyday communalism: Religious prejudices, stereotypes, and beliefs about religious superiority that are so common they often go unnoticed
- Quest for political dominance: Can manifest as majoritarian dominance or minority separatism
- Political mobilization: Using religious symbols, leaders, and emotional appeals to bring followers together politically
- Communal violence: Instances of riots and massacres, particularly during Partition and in post-independence India

### Secularism in India

- Indian constitution established a secular state with specific provisions:
  - No official state religion, unlike Pakistan (Islam) or England (Christianity)
  - Freedom to profess, practice, and propagate any religion
  - Prohibition of discrimination based on religion
  - State intervention in religious matters to ensure equality (e.g., banning untouchability)
- Secularism is a foundational principle of India, not just an ideology of certain parties

## Caste and Politics

### Caste System and Changes

- Caste system is special to India, representing an extreme form of hereditary occupational division sanctioned by rituals
- System created exclusion and discrimination, particularly through untouchability
- Social reformers like Phule, Gandhi, Ambedkar, and Periyar worked to eliminate caste inequalities
- Modern changes include:
  - Economic development and urbanization
  - Growth of literacy and education
  - Occupational mobility
  - Weakening position of landlords in villages

### Continuing Caste Inequalities

- Despite changes, caste remains an important source of economic inequality
- Statistics show:
  - The average economic status still follows caste hierarchy
  - Proportion living in extreme poverty is higher for lower castes
  - Upper castes are overrepresented among the wealthy
- Most marriages still occur within castes
- Upper castes have disproportionate representation in the urban middle class
- Untouchability persists despite constitutional prohibition

### Caste in Politics

- Caste considerations in candidate selection and government formation
- Appeals to caste sentiment during elections
- Association of political parties with specific castes

### Why Caste Alone Cannot Determine Election Results

- No parliamentary constituency has a majority of a single caste
- Not all voters of a caste vote for the same party
- Many constituencies have multiple candidates from the same caste
- Ruling parties and incumbents frequently lose elections
- Voters' attachment to parties often exceeds caste loyalty
- Economic differences within castes affect voting patterns
- Government performance and leader popularity are often decisive factors

### Politics in Caste (How Politics Affects Caste)

- Caste groups expand by incorporating neighboring castes
- Coalition-building requires dialogue between different caste groups
- New political categories emerge ("backward" and "forward" castes)
- Political expression gives disadvantaged communities space to demand power
- Dalit and OBC communities have gained better access to decision-making

### Positive and Negative Impacts

- Positive: Provides space for the disadvantaged to demand equal treatment and resources
- Negative: Can divert attention from other pressing issues like poverty and corruption
- In some cases, leads to tension, conflict, and violence

## Social and Religious Diversity in India

- Census data shows religious composition: Hindus (79.8%), Muslims (14.2%), Christians (2.3%), Sikhs (1.7%), and others
- Scheduled Castes (16.6%) and Scheduled Tribes (8.6%) make up significant portions of the population
- OBCs estimated at around 41% of population
- SCs, STs, and OBCs together form about two-thirds of India's population
