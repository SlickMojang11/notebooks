# Power Sharing: Understanding Democratic Governance - Enhanced Study Notes

## Introduction to Power Sharing

- Power sharing is a cornerstone of democratic systems, representing the distribution of authority among various entities within a state.
- It encompasses:
  - Division of power among primary organs of government (legislature, executive, judiciary)
  - Allocation of responsibilities across different governance levels (central to local)
  - Inclusion of diverse social groups (religious and linguistic communities)
  - Participation of various political actors (parties, pressure groups, movements)
- Power sharing ensures no single entity holds absolute control, fostering a balanced and inclusive political landscape.
- The essence of democracy lies in distributing power among people and their representatives rather than concentrating it among a few.
- Power sharing maintains political stability and serves as a practical approach to conflict resolution.

## Case Studies in Power Sharing

### A. Belgium: A Model of Accommodation

- **Population Composition**:
  - Dutch-speaking Flemish: 59%
  - French-speaking Walloons: 40%
  - German-speaking minority: 1%
  - Brussels: 80% French-speaking, 20% Dutch-speaking

- **Historical Context**:
  - French-speaking community historically held greater wealth and power despite being a minority nationally
  - Socio-economic disparities fueled tensions between linguistic groups during 1950s-1960s
  - Belgian leaders recognized potential conflict and chose accommodation

- **Constitutional Approach**:
  - Constitution amended four times between 1970-1993
  - Demonstrated sustained commitment to inclusive governance structure

- **Key Features of Belgian Power Sharing**:
  1. Equal representation in central government (equal Dutch and French-speaking ministers)
  2. Critical laws require majority support from each linguistic group
  3. Devolution of central powers to regional governments (Flanders and Wallonia)
  4. Special status for Brussels with equal representation
  5. Unique "community government" for cultural, educational, and language matters

- **Outcomes**:
  - Averted major civic strife between linguistic communities
  - Prevented potential division of the country
  - Brussels chosen as EU headquarters, indicating international recognition of success
  - Maintained national unity by respecting distinct community interests

### B. Sri Lanka: The Consequences of Majoritarianism

- **Population Composition**:
  - Sinhala-speaking: 74%
  - Tamil-speaking: 18% (Sri Lankan Tamils 13%, Indian Tamils 5%)
  - Religious divisions: Most Sinhala are Buddhists; most Tamils are Hindus or Muslims
  - Christians: 7% (both Tamil and Sinhala)

- **Post-Independence Developments**:
  - Rise of majoritarianism after independence in 1948
  - Sinhala leaders established dominance leveraging numerical majority
  - 1956: Act passed making Sinhala the sole official language
  - Government policies favored Sinhala applicants in university admissions and employment
  - New constitution mandated protection and fostering of Buddhism

- **Consequences for Tamil Community**:
  - Growing alienation among Sri Lankan Tamils
  - Perception that major political parties were insensitive to their language and culture
  - Feeling of discrimination in jobs, education, and political rights
  - Formation of Tamil political parties demanding language recognition and autonomy
  - Escalation to demands for independent Tamil Eelam state by 1980s

- **Outcome**:
  - Eruption of prolonged civil war (ended in 2009)
  - Thousands of lives lost
  - Families displaced as refugees
  - Severe hampering of national progress
  - Deep social scars

### C. Comparative Analysis



| Feature | Belgium | Sri Lanka |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Ethnic Diversity** | Dutch (Majority), French (Minority), German (Very Small Minority) | Sinhala (Majority), Tamil (Minority) |
| **Approach to Diversity** | Accommodation: Constitutional amendments to ensure equal representation and community governance | Majoritarianism: Policies favoring the Sinhala majority, disregarding the Tamil minority |
| **Power Sharing** | Yes, at central, state, and community levels | No significant power sharing with the Tamil minority |
| **Outcome** | Peaceful coexistence, avoided civil strife, Brussels as EU headquarters | Civil war, social and economic setbacks |
| **Key Lesson** | Unity achieved by respecting diverse interests and sharing power | Unity undermined by majority dominance and refusal to share power |

## Forms of Power Sharing in Modern Democracies

### A. Horizontal Distribution of Power

- Sharing power among different organs of government at the same level
- Involves legislature (makes laws), executive (implements laws), and judiciary (interprets laws)
- Also known as "separation of powers"
- Different branches exercise distinct powers while operating at the same level
- Incorporates system of checks and balances
- Each organ can scrutinize and limit actions of others
- Prevents concentration of power and potential abuse
- Example: In India, judiciary reviews laws and executive actions; executive implements legislature's laws

### B. Vertical Distribution of Power

- Involves sharing power among governments at different levels
- Commonly referred to as federalism or federal division of power
- Power divided between central government and provincial/state governments
- Allows for unified national government while accommodating regional diversities
- Constitution defines powers and responsibilities of each level
- Example: India's Union Government and State Governments
- Can extend to lower levels like municipalities and panchayats
- In true federalism, state governments enjoy autonomy in defined spheres
- Ensures governance is both comprehensive nationally and responsive locally

### C. Power Sharing Among Different Social Groups

- Power shared among religious and linguistic communities
- Critical in diverse societies for inclusive governance
- Ensures all significant social groups have voice and stake
- Prevents alienation and marginalization
- Example: Belgium's 'Community Government' for language groups
- Example: India's reserved constituencies for Scheduled Castes and Tribes
- Fosters inclusivity, social harmony, and sense of belonging

### D. Power Sharing Among Political Parties, Pressure Groups, and Movements

- Extends to interactions among various political entities
- Competition among parties prevents power concentration
- Coalition governments formed when no single party has clear majority
- Pressure groups represent specific interests (traders, farmers, workers)
- Pressure groups influence through committees, lobbying, mobilization
- Social movements raise awareness and exert pressure on government
- Ensures power isn't confined to formal government structures
- Creates dynamic interplay in broader political landscape
