    * Dimensions:
        * Long and healthy life: life expectancy at birth.1</sup>
        * Education level: mean and expected years of schooling.1</sup>
        * Decent living standard: GNI per capita (PPP adjusted).1</sup>

**5. Point Details with Key Explanations**



* **Different people, different goals** 1</sup>
    * **Definition/Explanation:** Development means different things to different people based on their aspirations and circumstances.1</sup>
    * **Real-world or book-based example:**
        * Landless laborer: more paid work, better wages.1</sup>
        * Prosperous farmer: higher crop prices, affordable labor.1</sup>
        * Industrialists (dams): electricity for factories.2</sup>
        * Tribal communities/farmers (dams): displacement, loss of livelihood.2</sup>
    * **Key takeaway:** Development goals are subjective and can conflict.
* **Income and other criteria** 1</sup>
    * **Definition/Explanation:** While income is important, non-material factors also contribute to quality of life.1</sup>
    * **Real-world or book-based example:**
        * Non-material goals: equal treatment, freedom, security, respect.1</sup>
        * Job preference: lower pay with security vs. high pay without security.1</sup>
        * Safe environment empowers women's participation in work/business.1</sup>
    * **Key takeaway:** Development includes both material and non-material aspects.
* **National Development** 1</sup>
    * **Definition/Explanation:** Development at the country level, enhancing living standards.2</sup>
    * **Real-world or book-based example:** Different segments of the population may have varying ideas about national progress.1</sup>
    * **Key takeaway:** National development visions can differ among citizens.
* **How to Compare Different Countries or States?** 1</sup>
    * **Definition/Explanation:** Using indicators to compare development levels, with income as a primary criterion.1</sup>
    * **Sub-topic: Average Income** 1</sup>
        * **Definition/Explanation:** Per capita income (total income / total population) used for comparison.1</sup>
        * **Real-world or book-based example:** World Bank classifies countries based on per capita income (high, low).1</sup> India is a low middle-income country.1</sup>
        * **Key takeaway:** Average income is a common but limited comparison tool.
    * **Sub-topic: Income and Other Criteria** 1</sup>
        * **Definition/Explanation:** Average income doesn't show income distribution or social factors.1</sup>
        * **Real-world or book-based example:**
            * Two countries with same average income but different distribution (Table 1.2 in NCERT 1</sup>).
            * Comparison of Haryana, Kerala, Bihar based on income, IMR, literacy, attendance (Tables 1.3 & 1.4 in NCERT 1</sup>). Haryana has higher income but lower in other indicators than Kerala.1</sup>
        * **Key takeaway:** Other indicators like health and education are crucial.
* **Public facilities** 1</sup>
    * **Definition/Explanation:** Essential services provided by government/collectively (water, sanitation, healthcare, education).1</sup>
    * **Real-world or book-based example:**
        * Money can't buy everything (pollution-free environment, disease protection).1</sup>
        * Kerala's low IMR due to good public health/education.1</sup>
        * Importance of government schools.1</sup>
        * Tamil Nadu's better PDS leading to better health.1</sup>
    * **✅ Keypoint:** Non-income factors are critical for development.1</sup>
* **Human Development Report** 1</sup>
    * **Definition/Explanation:** Published by UNDP, compares countries based on education, health, and income.1</sup> Focuses on citizens' well-being.1</sup>
    * **Real-world or book-based example:** Table 1.6 (NCERT 1</sup>) compares India and neighbors on GNI per capita, life expectancy, schooling, and HDI rank. Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh have better HDI ranks than income suggests.1</sup> India's HDI rank was 134 in 2022.16</sup>
    * **Key takeaway:** HDI provides a broader view of development beyond income.
* **Sustainability of development** 1</sup>
    * **Definition/Explanation:** Development that doesn't harm future generations' ability to meet their needs.1</sup>
    * **Sub-topic: Groundwater in India** 1</sup>
        * **Definition/Explanation:** Overuse of renewable groundwater leading to depletion.1</sup>
        * **Real-world or book-based example:** 300 districts in India reported significant groundwater decline.1</sup>
        * **Key takeaway:** Renewable resources can be used unsustainably.
    * **Sub-topic: Exhaustion of Natural Resources** 1</sup>
        * **Definition/Explanation:** Depletion of non-renewable resources like crude oil.1</sup>
        * **Real-world or book-based example:** Table 1.7 (NCERT 1</sup>) shows crude oil reserves and estimated lifespan. Impacts countries relying on imports.1</sup>
        * **Key takeaway:** Reliance on finite resources poses long-term challenges.
