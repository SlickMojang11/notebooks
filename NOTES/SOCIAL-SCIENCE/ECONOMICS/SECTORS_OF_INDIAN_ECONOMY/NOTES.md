- Sectoral contributions to GDP reveal the changing structure of the economy
- Transition from primary sector dominance to tertiary sector leadership reflects economic maturation

**Employment Share**:
- Employment distribution across sectors differs from GDP contribution pattern
- Primary sector employs largest proportion despite lower GDP contribution
- This disparity suggests underemployment or disguised unemployment
- Lower productivity per person in primary sector leads to lower per capita income

**Sector-wise Contribution to GDP and Employment**:

| Sector | Contribution to GDP (FY 2023-24) | Share of Employment (2023) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Primary Sector | ~17.66% | ~44% |
| Secondary Sector | ~27.62% | ~28% |
| Tertiary Sector | ~54.72% | ~34% |
